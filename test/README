Test instructions
=================

To run the unit tests, you need the NovaProva unit test framework. As
of writing, this is not yet packaged for Debian Linux but some other
distributions may have it already.

Especially install instructions: http://novaprova.readthedocs.org/en/latest/getting-started.html
Github repo: https://github.com/novaprova/novaprova

Once you have it installed, you need to compile ainod with tests enabled:

    ./autogen.sh --enable-tests
    make
    make check

The make check command runs the tests.
