Ainod - JSON Storage and Retrieval Daemon
=========================================

Ainod is a daemon (background service) that accepts JSON objects and
stores and retrieves them for you.

You could describe ainod as a NoSQL database or a document database
but ainod uses plain text JSON files as the primary storage format
rather than a proprietary binary data format.

Depepencies
-----------

Ainod is written in C and targets Linux.

To compile the binary, you need the development headers for json-c and
systemd. On Debian, Ubuntu and similar .deb based distributions, you
can use this command:

sudo apt-get install libjson-c-dev libsystemd-dev

On Fedora or similar .rpm based distributions, you can use:

dnf install json-c-devel systemd-devel

or if you are old school:

yum install json-c-devel systemd-devel

Installation
------------

Compile ainod using:

./autogen.sh
./configure
make
sudo make install
