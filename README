Ainod - JSON Storage and Retrieval Daemon
=========================================

Ainod is a daemon (background service) that accepts JSON objects and
stores and retrieves them for you.

You could describe ainod as a NoSQL database or a document database
but ainod uses plain text JSON files as the primary storage format
rather than a proprietary binary data format.

Depepencies
-----------

Ainod is written in C and targets operating systems that have the
Linux kernel, for other operating systems see below.

To compile the binary, you need the development headers for json-c and
systemd. On Debian, Ubuntu and similar .deb based distributions, you
can use this command:

sudo apt-get install libjson-c-dev libsystemd-dev uuid-dev

You will also need a C build environment which you can install using:

sudo apt-get install build-essential autoconf

On Fedora or similar .rpm based distributions, you can use:

dnf install json-c-devel systemd-devel uuid-devel

or if you are old school:

yum install json-c-devel systemd-devel uuid-devel

Installation
------------

Compile ainod using:

./autogen.sh
./configure
make

To install it to the system:

sudo make install

If you don't want to install it systemwide, you can run ainod from
userspace using:

cd src
./ainod

Unit Tests
----------

Unit test support is not built in by default. To run the unit tests,
you need the NovaProva unit test framework. Instructions for getting
that are here:
http://novaprova.readthedocs.org/en/latest/getting-started.html

Once you have it installed, you need to compile ainod with tests
enabled:

./autogen.sh --enable-tests
make

The make check command runs the tests:

make check

Other Operating Systems
-----------------------

Currently ainod makes no attempt at supporting other operating
systems. Firstly, it is easier to get the overall design first
without adding until later all the 'if Linux do this, if Windows do
that' checks.

However, there is nothing really stopping us adding other operating
systems except time and available test hardware. Support for other
operating systems may emerge if there is a some corporate sponsorship
for us to add it or someone in the community wants to add it for us.
